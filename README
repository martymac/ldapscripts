Ldapscripts - README file
*************************

Description :
*************

The ldapscripts are originally designed to be used within Samba 3.x's
smb.conf file. They allow to manipulate POSIX entries for users, groups
and machines in an LDAP directory. They are written in shell and need ldap 
client commands to work correctly (ldapadd, ldapdelete, ldapmodify,
ldapsearch). Other scripts also are provided as simple tools to (manually)
query your LDAP directory : ldapfinger, ldapid, lsldap (...).

They are designed to be used under GNU/Linux or FreeBSD (any other
recent UNIX-like should also work) and require several binaries that should 
come with your OS (uuencode, getent/pw, date, grep, sed, cut...).

Latest version available on http://contribs.martymac.org

Installing and configuring the ldapscripts :
********************************************

To install the scripts, just type in :
# make install
or, to define a special installation directory :
# make PREFIX=/target/directory install

Use 'make help' for more options.

All the scripts will be copied (by default) to /usr/local/sbin and 
ldapscripts.conf will be copied to /usr/local/etc/ldapscripts.

Keep in mind that the scripts are installed with quite restrictive rights.
You may have to play with group rights or ACLs (if they are enabled
on your system) to make the things work...

Once installed, edit /usr/local/etc/ldapscripts/ldapscripts.conf to 
configure the ldapscripts.

Then, just type in - e.g. :
# ldapadduser foo foogroup

See ldapscripts(5) for more details.

Configuring your OpenLDAP server :
**********************************

Be sure to include these schemas in your slapd.conf :

- core.schema
- cosine.schema (for the account objectClass)
- nis.schema (for the posixAccount objectClass) or a modified
  RFC 2307bis compliant version of this file if you plan to use
  AUXILIARY posixGroup objectClasses together with groupOfNames,
  groupOfUniqueNames or groupOfMembers objectClasses (see GCLASS
  parameter in the ldapscripts.conf file).

Using the ldapscripts with Samba 3.x :
**************************************

To use the ldapscripts with Samba 3.x (e.g. for a Windows -> Samba migration),
just add the following to your smb.conf file :

# [...]
add machine script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapaddmachine '%u' sambamachines
add user script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapadduser '%u' sambausers
add group script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapaddgroup '%g'
add user to group script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapaddusertogroup '%u' '%g'
delete user script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapdeleteuser '%u'
delete group script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapdeletegroup '%g'
delete user from group script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapdeleteuserfromgroup '%u' '%g'
set primary group script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapsetprimarygroup '%u' '%g'
rename user script = /usr/local/sbin/ldaprenameuser '%uold' '%unew'
# [...]

and make sure sambamachines and sambausers exist before attempting to 
do a "net rpc vampire"...
