  - Fix man pages installation
    (broken by wrong `` -> $() substitutions in Makefile)

2011/04/18 : ldapscripts 2.0.0
  - Next user and machine IDs now evolve independently (Debian bug #609148) :
      - they are guessed from their respective suffix
      - they are checked to avoid duplicates (against local and LDAP accounts)
    LDAP IDs are not re-used, except for the last ones (if previously released)
    in each suffix. If an ID is found to be used, the scripts will iterate
    (you really want to avoid that situation !) and use the first free ID.

    Given this behaviour, it is advised to clearly design user and machine
    ID ranges and correctly set UIDSTART and MIDSTART in ldapscripts.conf.

    You may want to use the following configuration (default) :
      UIDSTART=10000
      MIDSTART=20000

    This will leave 9999 free local system user accounts, 9999 free LDAP user
    accounts and 20000 to <max UID> free LDAP machine accounts.

  Internals :
  - renamed _findlast{user,group,machine} functions to _findnext{uid,gid,mid}
  - functions _findnextuid and _findnextmid now look for accounts in their own
    suffix
  - functions _findnextuid, _findnextgid and _findnextmid now check if the
    resulting ID is used or not and return results through stdout
  - functions _grouptogid, _gidtogroup, _usertouid, _uidtouser and _uidtodn now
    return results through stdout and do not end_die anymore if no ID is found
  - replaced expr calls with shell arithmetic expansion calls $(())
  - replaced `` calls with shell command substitution calls $()
  - use eval for each GETENT*CMD call to avoid a "command not found" error when
    expanding command names containing spaces, e.g. (on zsh) :
    $ COMMAND="getent passwd" ; $COMMAND martymac
    command not found: getent passwd

2011/02/08 : ldapscripts 1.10.0
  - Added support for groupOfNames/groupOfUniqueNames group entries
    used in conjunction with RFC 2307bis AUXILIARY posixGroups.
    It is now possible to handle member users as, respectively, member
    or uniqueMember full DN entries.

  => thanks to Àngel "muzzol" Bosch for the original patches !

  - Added initial support for SASL authentication

  => thanks to Brian Candler for the original patches !

  - Now use 'logname' instead of 'id' to guess current user
    (sudo users will now be logged correctly and be able to run
    ldapid/ldapfinger without argument)
  - Cleaned log file messages format up
  - Updated WWW, Copyrights
  - Several other minor changes and fixes...

2009/07/16 : ldapscripts 1.9.0
  - Fixed a few lines in man pages
  - Changed PASSWORDGEN's default value to not use uuencode anymore
  - Use 'id' command instead of 'logname' to guess current user (used by ldapfinger and ldapid)
    Be careful if you want to act on your own account using su/sudo !
  - New DESTDIR variable in Makefile, to specify a global chroot as a target directory for installation
  
  => thanks to Alexander GQ Gerasiov for those 4 fixes !

  - New 'ldapgid' command to display a group's list of IDs

2008/08/10 : ldapscripts 1.8.0
  - No changes since 1.8.0rc1, but tests have been performed
    on Debian and Ubuntu with success, so let's rock !
    (Adam, thanks again :))

2008/08/08 : ldapscripts 1.8.0rc1
  - HEADS UP ! The scripts are no longer named using a heading '_'. This
    prefix was used to differentiate extra commands not directly useable by Samba
    (in the smb.conf configuration file), but as the ldapscripts start being more
    and more used as everyday admin tools, a heading '_' just leads to confusion
    and annoyance. I have finally decided to remove them.
    Here is the renaming scheme :

      _ldapdeletemachine -> ldapdeletemachine
      _ldapfinger -> ldapfinger
      _ldapinit -> ldapinit
      _ldapmodifygroup -> ldapmodifygroup
      _ldapmodifymachine -> ldapmodifymachine
      _ldapmodifyuser -> ldapmodifyuser
      _ldaprenamegroup -> ldaprenamegroup
      _ldaprenamemachine -> ldaprenamemachine
      _lsldap -> lsldap

    And, to avoid collision with OpenLDAP's ldappasswd command :

      _ldappasswd -> ldapsetpasswd

    (T.H., I hope you'll enjoy that change ;-))

  - HEADS UP (yes, again) ! Since the ldapscripts are admin-oriented, they
    are now installed to the sbin/ directory by default. This should not change
    lots of things for you since they were installed root/750 into bin/.
    The runtime file has also moved to the lib/ldapscripts directory.

  - added support for character set conversion : the ldapscripts now use
    (packagers should read : *depends on*) iconv (UTF-8 conversion) and
    uudecode (base64 decoding).
    See ICONVBIN, ICONVCHAR and UUDECODEBIN options in ldapscripts.conf.
    You can leave ICONVBIN and UUDECODEBIN unset to disable any kind of
    conversion (by default, character set conversion and base64 decoding
    are turned on, so you will have to set your local charset - ICONVCHAR -
    before using the scripts).
  - new 'ldapid' command shows a user's list of id (just like the 'id'
    command does). See ldapid(1) for more details.
  - ldapfinger : added -u, -g and -m options to force restricted lookups.
    Using ldapfinger with no argument now acts on current user (using
    logname(1)).
  - ldapinit : fixed Debian bug #421064 by adding a continue (-c) option to _ldapadd
    (and _ldapmodify) functions. ldapinit will now continue to initialize LDAP tree
    if a previous entry already exists.
  - ldapsetpasswd : fixed a bug in wrong exit result, introduced by the use
    of a temporary file for changing password (ldapscripts 1.7.1).
  - ldapadduser : fixed typo when preserving permissions from HOMESKEL (cp -P -> -p).
  - all errors/warnings are now reported to STDERR (new warn_log function replaces
    several echo_log calls).

  Contributed from Adam Sommer (thanks a lot !) :
  - added -h and --help options for each command.
  - resolver functions (uid/gid <-> user/group) now try to use LDAP if
    local lookup (using pw or getent) fails. As a consequence, the scripts
    will *not* accept to use unresolved entries anymore (e.g. when adding
    memberUids).
  - it is now possible to set PASSWORDGEN to '<ask>'. You then will be prompted
    for a new password when adding a user with the 'ldapadduser' command.
  - added support for <ask> keyword in LDIF templates
    This new feature is available for ldapadduser, ldapaddgroup, ldapaddmachine
    and ldapinit. A new _askattrs fonction has been added to the runtime file.
    To use this feature, you may specify :
    ------
      attributeName: <ask>
    ------
    for example :
    ------
      description: Entry for <ask> in my LDAP directory
    ------
    in the templates used by the 4 commands above. Be careful, only one <ask> (the
    first one) will be replaced per line. Multivalued attributes are allowed (you can
    add several attributes sharing the same name and the <ask> option).

    As a consequence, the ASKGECOS option has been removed, since it can be performed
    using an <ask> option for the gecos attribute. Do not forget to update your
    configuration file and templates !

  Internals :
  - various typos and fixes
  - runtime :
    - new is_b64, _b64decode, _utf8encode, _utf8decode functions.
    - new _getattribute and _askpassword functions.
    - new is_like function.
    - _genpassword : do not eval PASSWORDGEN if empty or set to "<ask>".
    - mktempf : added more entropy to _TMPFILE naming using /dev/random.
      As a consequence, availability of /dev/random on the client system
      is now mandatory to run the scripts.
    - sed and grep arguments cleanup (removed unnecessary -E and -e).
  - Makefile :
    - RUNDIR has been renamed to LIBDIR.
      New [un]installlib targets to [un]install the runtime file.
    - Replaced mkdir calls with 'install -d' ones
      (may not be available on every system).
    - Do not overwrite/delete configuration files / password file anymore
      if files exist or has changed (differ from .sample ones).

  That's all folks ;-)

2007/11/28 : ldapscripts 1.7.2
  - runtime : Use 'trap - <signal>' to restore traps instead of the uncommon 'trap -' syntax
  - runtime : Fix _changepasswd by removing the trailing newline character in the temporary file (echo -n)

2007/10/13 : ldapscripts 1.7.1
  - Fixes for CVE-2007-5373
    see http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5373
    and http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=445582

    1) Up to now, each ldap* command was called with the -w parameter, which allows to
      specify the bind password on the command line. Unfortunately, this could make the
      password appear to anybody performing a `ps` during the call. This is now avoided
      by using the -y parameter and a password file.
      
      -> A new BINDPWDFILE option has been added : it specifies the path to the bind
      password file. This file can be created by something like :
      'echo -n 'password' > $BINDPWDFILE' and you can now safely remove (or comment) the
      BINDPWD parameter from your configuration file.

    2) Changing a user password could also reveal the new password on the command line,
      because of the use of ldappasswd's -s option. This has been fixed by using a temporary
      file containing the new password (and ldappassword's -T option).

      -> [internals] New mktempf() and reltempf() functions have been added

    [For older versions of OpenLDAP, -y and -T parameters may not be available. It is still
    possible to use the old BINDPWD parameter. Just uncomment it from the configuration file
    and comment the BINDPWDFILE parameter (which takes precedence over BINDPWD). The
    ldapscripts will just behave as previously and use inline -w and -s parameters, warning
    you this is not secure way of running them.]

    3) A similar problem related to sed expressions has been found : it may also lead to
      reveal a user's password to `ps` users. This is now fixed by using temporary files
      containing sed expressions (and sed's -f option).

    4) A new test has been added to check if 'echo' and '[' are built-in or not. If not,
      you'll be warned that the ldapscripts may not be safe to use (because these commands
      manipulate passwords when creating temporary files).

      -> [internals] New is_builtin() function

    Note that these flaws depend largely on your kernel configuration : hardened kernels
    should not be impacted (e.g. if you use security.bsd.see_other_[u|g]ids sysctls on
    FreeBSD). It may also depend on the version of OpenLDAP client commands you run.

    Thanks a lot to Don and Madcoder for their help !

  - Few fixes to avoid using non-standard 'if ! command's...

2007/09/03 : ldapscripts 1.7

    - [internals] New is_integer function
  - _lsldap : new options : '-u', '-g' and '-m', to list only 'u'ser, 'g'roup or 'm'achine entries
  - New _ldapmodify{user,group,machine} interactive scripts to edit entries
    - Added a new $TMPDIR configuration variable (necessary for the new scripts)
    - Added _ldapmodify{user,group,machine}(1) manpages
  - Now bundled with a brand-new Makefile (old install script no more available)

2007/04/20 : ldapscripts 1.6
